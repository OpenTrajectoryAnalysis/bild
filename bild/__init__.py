Bayesian Inference of Loop Dynamics (BILD)

This module provides the implementation of BILD, proposed by `Gabriele,
Brand√£o, Grosse-Holz, et al. <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn6583>`_. Since
the ideas behind this scheme are explained in the paper (and its supplementary
information), in the code we only provide technical documentation, assuming
knowledge of the reference text.
